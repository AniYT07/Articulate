      <div class="d-inline-flex p-2" style={{fontFamily: "'Alkatra', 'cursive'", fontSize: '20px', color: 'white', marginLeft: '30px', marginRight: "150px"}}>In case you didn’t know, population growth simply refers to an increase in the number of individuals. However, population growth isn’t itself a problem (it’s is inevitable) but when the total number of individuals exceeds the carrying capacity of the environment, or I should say the environment loses its sustainability then that’s a problem. OVERPOPULATION is the actual problem, HOW? Glad you asked.
Consider the following factors-:<br/><br/>1{')'} POVERTY <br/> 2{')'} MORTALITY RATES <br/>3{')'} RESOURCE CONSUMPTION <br/> 4{')'} GLOBAL WARMING <br/><br/>All of the above factors will increase Now again, consider the following factors-: <br/><br/>1{')'} RESOURCES <br/> 2{')'} JOBS <br/>3{')'} PRIVILEGE <br/> 4{')'} LIFE EXPECTANCY <br/><br/> All of the above factors will decrease. Pretty scary right? But it’s not too late to work towards the same.</div>
          
      <h2 style={{fontFamily: "'Alkatra', 'cursive'", fontSize: '30px', color: 'white', marginLeft: '36px', marginTop: '50px'}}>SOLUTIONS</h2>
      <div class="d-inline-flex p-2" style={{fontFamily: "'Alkatra', 'cursive'", fontSize: '20px', color: 'white', marginLeft: '30px', marginRight: "150px"}}>Solutions for overpopulation are pretty simple to understand, but much harder to implement due to the HUGE diversity, ethnicity, principles, and the fact that this freaking planet has more than 7 billion people, just kidding, I love Earth. Below are the list and explanation of the solutions I personally find the best and so do the professional demographers.<br/>
      <br/>
      •	AWARENESS – it covers almost all the solution for overpopulation and is the one of the most effective solution at individual level. Poor contraceptive use, poverty, lack of resources, sexism, are all due to lack of education- which brings awareness to an individual. And all the mentioned social issues are directly connect to overpopulation.<br/><br/>
      {'->'} Birth control – Using proper contraceptive methods are vital in alleviating population growth. Why don’t just use it? Well there are several barriers like: lack of access and education, health problems and the worst, SOCIETY. Having safe birth control method will lead to minimal unintended pregnancies and will result in lower birth rates.
      <br/>{'->'} Reducing Poverty – The root cause of population growth. If you are not familiar with the concept of population growth, if you’re not literate, would be able to work towards the same? That is why awareness and education are vital for the poor. 
      <br/>{'->'} Empowering women/girls – This one’s connected with the first one, with better education, knowledge, and participation, women will have financial independence, resistance towards sexism, and accessibility to contraceptives.<br/><br/>
      •	GOVERNMENT INCENTIVES – Not a fan of this solution. However, if the situation gets more severe, then this might be the only option unless we can send half the population to a different planet. Government incentives include policies like one child legislation (having no more than one child), checked immigration (for countries with very limited resources for its own population), mandatory birth control (yep! This one is as messed up as it sounds cause it should be up to women) and many more.

A weapon having the capability of causing this kind of havoc produces an immense threat to humanity, this is one of the most important challenges engineers are facing and the same has been put forward in NAE’S 14 GRAND CHALLENGES. With the increase in production of nuclear energy, there will be an increased risk of fissile material (Material having the capability of undergoing nuclear fission) getting into the wrong hands and without proper methods to control, detect and determine the amount of fissile material in nuclear power plants and nuclear research labs, nuclear terror will continue to be an increased threat to humanity which seems to be the uttermost concern for humanity.</div> */}

All radioactive materials emit some sort of radiation (mostly gamma rays). A device to detect radiation can be used. Such type of device already exists. However, a device that can MEASURE the enormous amount of radiation emitted by the radioactive materials up to a particular area can made (Not easily but possibly). Geiger-Muller Counter already exist to measure radiation but that device simply won’t work with the proposed problem because it cannot measure high radiation level. Hypothetically, if this kind of device is installed in a nuclear power plant then it would be able to measure the amount of radiation produced by the fissile material in the plant, and if there is any unusual change in radiation the device will ring an alarm warning the authority about it. In other words, If fissile material leaves the nuclear power plant then the radiation level will go down which will be displayed on the device. With this solution, the possible smuggling of any radioactive material from the plant would not be a threat and the same thing could be done with shipping containers used for shipping fissile</div> */}

This methods will be one of the best way to detect and control radioactive elements, and will also help authorities to keep track of the materials use. The impact of this could be worldwide, as chances of NUCLEAR TERRORISM happening will be negligible and humanity will remain at peace.</div> */}
